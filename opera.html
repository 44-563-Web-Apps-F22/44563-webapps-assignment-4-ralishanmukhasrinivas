  <h6 class="name">CELIA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished
  Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland.  Why, she
  wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!  We sing her songs
  and we trip her measures, but we don't enjoy ourselves!</p>

  <h6 class="name">FLETA.</h6> <p class="speech">To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
  she was banished!  What could she have done to have deserved so
  terrible a punishment?</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Something awful!  She married a mortal!</p>
  <h6 class="name">FLETA.</h6>  <p class="speech"> Oh!  Is it injudicious to marry a mortal?</p>
  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech">  Injudicious?  It strikes at the root of the whole
  fairy system!  By our laws, the fairy who marries a mortal dies!</p>
  <h6 class="name">CELIA.</h6> <p class="speech"> But Iolanthe didn't die!
 <p class="direction">(Enter Fairy Queen.)</p></p>

  <p class="direction">[No, because your Queen, who loved her with a
  surpassing love, commuted her sentence to penal servitude for life,
  on condition that she left her husband and never communicated with
  him again]!</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> That sentence of penal servitude she is now working
  out, on her head, at the bottom of that stream!</p>

  <h6 class="name">QUEEN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes, but when I banished her, I gave her all the
  pleasant places of the earth to dwell in.  I'm sure I never
  intended that she should go and live at the bottom of a stream!  It
  makes me perfectly wretched to think of the discomfort she must
  have undergone!</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech">Think of the damp!  And her chest was always delicate.></p>
  <h6 class="name">QUEEN.</h6> <p class="speech">And the frogs!  Ugh!  I never shall enjoy any peace of
  mind until I know why Iolanthe went to live among the frogs!</p>
  <h6 class="name">FLETA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Then why not summon her and ask her?</p>
  <h6 class="name">QUEEN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Why?  Because if I set eyes on her I should forgive
  her at once!</p>

  <p class="direction">[Then why not forgive her?  Twenty-five years—it's a
  long time!]</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Think how we loved her!</p>
  <h6 class="name">QUEEN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Loved her?  What was your love to mine?  Why, she was
  invaluable to me!  Who taught me to curl myself inside a buttercup?
  Iolanthe!  Who taught me to swing upon a cobweb?  Iolanthe!  Who
  taught me to dive into a dewdrop—to nestle in a nutshell—to
  gambol upon gossamer?  Iolanthe!</p>

  <h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> She certainly did surprising things!></p>
  <h6 class="name">FLETA.</h6> <p class="speech"> Oh, give her back to us, great Queen, for your sake if
  not for ours!  <p class="direction">(All kneel in supplication.)</p></p>

  <h6 class="name">QUEEN<h6> <p class="direction">(irresolute)</p> <p class="speech"> Oh, I should be strong, but I am weak!
  I should be marble, but I am clay!  Her punishment has been heavier than I intended.I did not mean that she should live among the
  frogs—and—well, well, it shall be as you wish—it shall be as you wish!</p>
