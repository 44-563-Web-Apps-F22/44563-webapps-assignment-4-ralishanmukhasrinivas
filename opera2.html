<h6 class="name"> CELIA.</h6> <p class="speech">You seem annoyed.
<h6 class="name">LORD MOUNT. <p class="direction"> (Annoyed!  I should think so!)</p> <p class="speech"> Why, this
        ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
        To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
        open to Competitive Examination!</p>
<h6 class="name"> LORD TOLL.  And he'll carry it, too!</p>
<h6 class="name"> LORD MOUNT.  Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
        Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!</p>
<h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!
    LORD MOUNT.  The deuce it is!</p>
<h6 class="name">CELIA.</h6>  <p class="speech">Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
    just as he wishes them to.</p>
<h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> It's our system.  It shortens the debates.</p>
<h6 class="name">LORD TOLL.</h6> <p class="direction"> (Well, but think what it all means.)</p> <p class="speech">  I don't so
    much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!</p>
<h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6>  <p class="speech">I suppose it must!</p>
<h6 class="name">LORD MOUNT.</h6>  <p class="speech">I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
    a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
    with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
    what's to become of the House of Commons?</p>
<h6 class="name">LEILA.</h6> <p class="speech"> I never thought of that!</p>
<h6 class="name">LORD MOUNT.</h6> <p class="speech">This comes of women interfering in politics.  It
    so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
    is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
    Peers!</p>
